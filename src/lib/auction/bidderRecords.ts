/**
 * Bidder-side persistent record for each placed bid.
 *
 * Under `cashu_p2pk_bidder_path_v1` the bidder holds the derivation
 * path locally — losing it means the seller can't redeem the bid even
 * if the bidder wins. The bidder also holds the locked Cashu proofs
 * (full proofs including the `C` value) so they can refund via the
 * timelock branch if they grief or the seller is unreachable.
 *
 * Everything lives under user-scoped localStorage via the existing
 * wallet/storage helpers, so each Nostr identity has its own record
 * set and switching accounts doesn't bleed bid state across users.
 *
 * Threat model: the records contain the locked proofs (bearer
 * material) and the refund private key (used to claim the timelock
 * branch). Both are already locally-stored secrets in the user's
 * wallet; we're just adding auction-specific context on top.
