/**
 * #12: ADR-0008 state mapping. The ADR lists a full payment/bid state model
 * (see ADR-0008 §"Payment and Bid State Model"). Most ADR states map 1:1 to
 * lifecycle states with identical names; only the two non-obvious mappings
 * below need explicit documentation.
 *
 * Direct 1:1 mappings (not listed in the object):
 *   ADR "Funding session created"      → funding_session_created
 *   ADR "Invoice created"              → invoice_created
 *   ADR "Invoice paid" / "Wallet ack"  → payment_acknowledged
 *   ADR "E-cash minting attempted"     → minting_started
 *   ADR "E-cash minted"                → ecash_minted
 *   ADR "Invoice expired or unpaid"    → invoice_unpaid_or_expired_reclaimable
 *   ADR "Bid published"                → bid_published
 *   ADR "Bid publish attempted"        → bid_publish_attempted
 *   ADR "Funding failed, reclaimable"  → invoice_paid_mint_failed_reclaimable
 *                                         / mint_succeeded_bid_publish_failed_reclaimable
 *
 * Non-obvious mappings (listed in the object below):
 *   ADR "Bid lock conversion attempted" → bid_publish_attempted
 *     Lock conversion is folded into the publish attempt — we don't split it
 *     into a separate user-visible state because it's an atomic UX step.
 *   ADR "Bid lock conversion complete"  → ['bid_published', 'mint_succeeded_bid_publish_failed_reclaimable']
 *     Two terminal outcomes: success (bid_published) or publish failure with
 *     reclaimable funds (mint_succeeded_bid_publish_failed_reclaimable).
 *
 * ADR states without a dedicated lifecycle state:
 *   "Bid requested"        — represented by the initial `idle` state
 *   "Mint target resolved" — handled inside startFundingForBid() before
 *                            transitioning to funding_session_created
 *   "Invoice payment attempted" — external Lightning payment; no client state
 *                            between invoice_created and payment_acknowledged
 *   "Bid funding failed"   — generic; covered by the specific reclaimable states

/**
 * Reclaim / refund flow for reclaimable states:
 *
 * When a bid funding session ends in one of the reclaimable terminal states,
 * the user's sats are not lost — they remain as Cashu proofs at the mint,
 * locked under a P2PK timelock with a refund path. Recovery works as follows:
 *
 * 1. `invoice_unpaid_or_expired_reclaimable`: The Lightning invoice expired
 *    or was never paid. No funds were minted — nothing to reclaim. The user
 *    can simply start a new funding session.
 *
 * 2. `invoice_paid_mint_failed_reclaimable`: The invoice was paid but minting
 *    failed. Funds may be at the mint in a partially-minted state. The user
 *    can retry the funding session (transition back to funding_session_created
 *    is allowed), which re-attempts minting. If minting keeps failing, the
 *    pending token entry in nip60Store will eventually become eligible for
 *    reclaimToken() once the timelock expires.
 *
 * 3. `mint_succeeded_bid_publish_failed_reclaimable`: E-cash was minted but
 *    the bid event could not be published to relays. The proofs are in the
 *    user's wallet as a pending token. The user can retry publishing (transition
 *    back to bid_publish_attempted is allowed). If they abandon the bid, the
 *    funds are reclaimable via nip60Actions.reclaimToken() after the timelock.
 *
 * 4. `ecash_minted_pending_rules_ack`: E-cash was minted but the user hasn't
 *    acknowledged the auction rules yet. The funds are in the wallet as a
 *    pending token. If the user closes the modal, the pending bid is preserved
 *    (shouldPreservePendingBidSubmissionOnModalClose returns true). Once rules
 *    are acknowledged, publishing resumes. If abandoned, reclaimToken() recovers
 *    funds after the timelock.
 *
 * The actual reclaim implementation lives in nip60Actions.reclaimToken() in
 * src/lib/stores/nip60.ts. It:
 *   - Checks the timelock from the proof secret (not cached context)
 *   - Looks up the refund private key from BidderBidRecord or wallet.privkeys
 *   - Calls receiveTokenWithPrivkey() to sweep the locked proofs back
 *   - Marks the token as 'reclaimed' in pendingTokens
 * An auto-reclaim sweep runs periodically with exponential backoff; the user
 * can also manually trigger reclaim from the UI.

	/**
	 * #1235 Blocking 1 — idempotent retry from
	 * `mint_succeeded_bid_publish_failed_reclaimable`.
	 *
	 * Three retry paths:
	 *
	 * - **Reclaim-only (#1235 follow-up 3, when the leg failed post-lock but
	 *   pre-publishable):** `AuctionBidLockedButUnpublishedError` recorded the
	 *   lock token id — funds are known to be locked but there is no
	 *   durably-recoverable publishable kind-1023. Retry must NEVER re-run
	 *   the pipeline (double-lock) and has nothing to rebroadcast: surface
	 *   the reclaim path instead.
	 *
	 * - **Idempotent rebroadcast (preferred, whenever the failed publish
	 *   produced an event id):** `republishBid` rebroadcasts the exact
	 *   persisted signed kind-1023 — same event id, ZERO additional Cashu
	 *   swap/lock. Relays that already have the event deduplicate; relays
	 *   that missed it ingest it. Retrying a funded-but-unbroadcast publish
	 *   never double-locks the bidder.
	 *
	 * - **No id captured and nothing known to be locked (publish failed
	 *   before the kind-1023 was built — nothing was locked for this leg
	 *   yet):** falls back to the full `submitPreparedBid` pipeline. When an
	 *   id IS known but no `republishBid` callback is wired, we surface an
	 *   error instead of falling back — a retry must never re-run the lock
	 *   pipeline on an already-locked leg.
	 *
	 * Uses the preserved pendingBidSubmission so the user doesn't need to
	 * re-enter the bid amount or reselect mints.
